~  need to add "--" to all archivers launches (because files starting with "-"
   and "--" will not be processed)
~  what if archive (or output file) already exist?
~  need to exclude output files from $files variable
~  add "--" option (all "-o" and "--help" placed after it will be ignored). And
   do not forget to add -- to all archivers else they will try to process
   "--help" and so in their own way, not as a files
