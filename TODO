EasyPK TODO


~  what if archive (or output file) already exist?
~  what if "." or ".." specified as input or output file?
~  messages revision: add some nice things (bold, underlying, “” etcetera)
~  "-d" option -- delete files after adding them to archive (pk) or delete
   archive after unpacking it (unpk)
~  check for archivers and show error messages if not found
~  it's time to decide which license should I use for EasyPK. GNU GPL v3 looks
   good enough
~  show percentage of saved space (like bzip2 and gzip do after finishing
   packing)
~  show archive name in pv
