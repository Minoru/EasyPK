EasyPK TODO


~  what if "." or ".." specified as input or output file?
~  messages revision: add some nice things (bold, underlying, “” etcetera)
~  check for archivers and show error messages if not found
~  show percentage of saved space (like bzip2 and gzip do after finishing
   packing)
~  what if program was called in way like "pk filename"? Yeah, pk will ask user
   to specify *filenames*, but it might ask for *archive type*!
~  switch to mktemp utility for creating temporary dirs
