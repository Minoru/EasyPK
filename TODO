EasyPK TODO


~  what if "." or ".." specified as input or output file?
~  messages revision: add some nice things (bold, underlying, “” etcetera)
~  check for archivers and show error messages if not found
~  it's time to decide which license should I use for EasyPK. GNU GPL v3 looks
   good enough
~  show percentage of saved space (like bzip2 and gzip do after finishing
   packing)
~  need to do revision of options used in code. For example, "pv -s" isn't
   very good understandable, "pv --size" will be much better.
~  what if program was called in way like "pk filename"? Yeah, pk will ask user
   to specify *filenames*, but it might ask for *archive type*!
