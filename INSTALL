As far as EasyPK is just a BASH scripts, you don't need to compile them -
just make sure you have BASH installed.

There is man pages called pk.1 and unpk.1 too. You should move them to
/usr/share/man/man1 directory and give everyone read access. Note that only
root can write to /usr/share/man/man1/.
