 What EasyPK is?

EasyPK is distribution of two BASH scripts named pk and unpk which handles
archive creating and unpacking operations. Run every utility with --help swith
and read usage notes - it will be enough for using scripts.

 Which progams EasyPK requires?

You must have archivers installed for handling corresponging archives - bzip2
for bz2, gzip for gz, tar for tar and so on. Full list of supported archives
and file types:

Program     File extension
tar         tar
bzip2       bz2, tar.bz2
gzip        gz, tar.gz
zip         zip
rar         rar
7zip        7z

Also you will need pv utility for displaying nice progress bars with speed and
estimated time. Actually, pv isn't really needed, scripts will work even without
it, but you'll lose progress bars.


 How to install it in my system?

Just move pk and unpk files to any direstory presented in your PATH environment
variable.
