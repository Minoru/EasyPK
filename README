EasyPK README

What EasyPK is?
---------------

EasyPK is a distribution of two BASH scripts (named pk and unpk) that handle
archive creating, compressing, uncompressing and unpacking. Run every utility
with -h switch and read usage notes - it will be enough to start using them.
You can also install man pages (read INSTALL first) and read them, too.


Which archive types does EasyPK support?
----------------------------------------

EasyPK can pack and unpack tar, zip, gzip, bzip2, rar and 7z archives. Note,
though, that your particular installation may be missing some capabilities
because of missing archivers. Install them all to get most of EasyPK.


Which progams EasyPK requires?
------------------------------

You must have archivers installed for handling corresponding archives - bzip2
for bz2, gzip for gz, tar for tar and so on. Full list of all the programs
that EasyPK can utilize: tar, gzip, pigz (parallel gzip), bzip2, pbzip2
(parallel bzip2), rar, p7zip, p7zip-rar, xz and pixz (parallel xz).

You may also need pv utility to display nice progress bars with processing
speed and estimated time. Actually, pv isn't really needed, scripts will work
even without it, but you'll lose progress bars.


How to install it in my system?
-------------------------------

Read INSTALL.
