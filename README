EasyPK README

What EasyPK is?
---------------

EasyPK is distribution of two BASH scripts named pk and unpk which handles
archive creating and unpacking operations. Run every utility with -h switch and
read usage notes - it will be enough for using scripts. You can install man
pages (read INSTALL first) and read them otherwise.


Which archive types EasyPK supports?
------------------------------------

EasyPK can pack and unpack tar, gzip, bzip2, rar and 7z archives. Note, though,
that your particular installation may be missing some capabilities because of
missing archivers. Install them all to get most of EasyPK.


Which progams EasyPK requires?
------------------------------

You must have archivers installed for handling corresponging archives - bzip2
for bz2, gzip for gz, tar for tar and so on. Full list of all the programs
which could be required: tar, gzip, bzip2, rar, p7zip, p7zip-rar.

Also, you will need pv utility for displaying nice progress bars with speed and
estimated time. Actually, pv isn't really needed, scripts will work even without
it, but you'll lose progress bars.


How to install it in my system?
-------------------------------

Read INSTALL.
