EasyPK CHANGELOG

2.2:
+  Switched to getopts for handling command line parameters.
+  "--help" parameter changed to "-h" (due to getopts limitations).
+  EasyPK now can handle files with names starts with dashes (i.e.,
   "--somefile.zip").
+  Warning if file passed to gzip/bzip2 isn't regular
   Now if you will try to do something like "pk bz2 /dev/urandom" or
   "pk gz /tmp/" you will get message saying that gzip/bzip2 doesn't work with
   non-regular files (directories, block devices etc.)
+  Minor bug fixes.

2.1:
+  Initial relise on GitHub.
+  Refactoring. I need to think little more before writing code.
+  Check for pv added (idea by Raging_Hog).
   If utility isn't avaliable, standard "v" switches of archivers will be
   enabled.

2.0:

+  "-o" switch added to pk. It allows user to specify archive filename. Works
   with tgz, tbz, tar, rar, zip and 7z archive types only. If no output file
   specified, name of current directory (with appropriate extension) will be
   used.
+  help message (and "--help" switch) added.
+  pv used for progres bar (idea by greatx).
+  First version. I just took Zend's code from here - http://welinux.ru/post/1177
   - and started rewriting it.
