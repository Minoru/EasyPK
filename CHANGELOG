EasyPK CHANGELOG

2.1:
+  Initial relise on GitHub.
+  Refactoring. I need to think little more before writing code.
+  Check for pv added (idea by Raging_Hog).
   If utility isn't avaliable, standard "v" switches of archivers will be
   enabled.

2:

+  "-o" switch added to pk. It allows user to specify archive filename. Works
   with tgz, tbz, tar, rar, zip and 7z archive types only. If no output file
   specified, name of current directory (with appropriate extension) will be
   used.
+  help message (and "--help" switch) added.
+  pv used for progres bar (idea by greatx).
+  First version. I just took Zend's code from here - http://welinux.ru/post/1177
   - and started rewriting it.
